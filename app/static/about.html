<h3>About</h3>
    <p>Hi! I'm Brian, and I developed this tool because I really love games. The code will soon be available on <a href="https://github.com/BrianWilliamSmith/">Github</a>.</p>
<h3> Instructions</h3>
    <p>The app requires two inconvenient things to access your games and make recommendations:</p>
<ul><li>Your steam id (<a href="https://support.ubisoft.com/en-GB/Faqs/000027522/Finding-your-Steam-ID?fallback=en_GB">oof -- kind of a pain</a>)</li>
    <li>A steam profile set to public with shared game details</li></ul>
<p>The second one is unavoidable. A few years ago, Valve changed the default profile settings to hidden. Here's how to change them back:</p>
<ol><li>Sign into Steam</li>
    <li>Click on your profile name in the upper right corner and select "View My Profile"</li>
    <li>Select "Edit Profile > "My Privacy Settings"</li>
    <li>Change profile visibility and game details to "public"</br>(The app needs to know game playtime, so make sure you don't hide that!)</li>
</ol>
